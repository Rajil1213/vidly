A simple API for managing movie rentals based on [NodeJS MasterClass](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-master-class/learn), a course taught on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) by [Mosh Hamedani](https://twitter.com/moshhamedani).

## Caveats
* All packages are updated as of Dec 2022 (while the course itself has not been updated since 2018).
* The source code and notes are all based on TypeScript (while the course itself uses JavaScript).
* Deployment is via Docker (while the course uses Heroku)

## Prerequisites
* You should have docker installed (supporting compose file version 3.9 or above).
## How to Run?
```bash
${PROJECT_DIR}/build.sh
```

## Notes
All of my lecture-by-lecture notes are available on [Notion](https://dog-fireplant-fdf.notion.site/0844a124fd8e4d75989177b42558b1fb?v=b8bb2b11e6a744bda338ef20d2a9cfb0).
